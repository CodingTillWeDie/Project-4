1. CS 2400 Project 4 done by Kevin Kim, Sean Abi Saab, and Hemil Bhavsar.
2. Kevin Kim read a sequence of integers from the input files "data_random.txt" and "data_sorted.txt" in "HeapDriver.java". He also performed heap operations and wrote the results into an output file called "outputFile.txt" in the driver program. Sean Abi Saab helped write the MaxHeapInterface.java and MaxHeap.java classes. In MaxHeap.java, he implemented two methods of building a max-heap and the remove method of a max-heap. He also wrote and created the Javadocs for this project. Hemil Bhavsar helped write the MaxHeapInterface.java and MaxHeap.java classes.
3. For this project, we used Java interface. We also have included Javadoc that briefly explains all the methods for this project.
