1. CS 2400 Project 4 done by Hemil Bhavsar, Kevin Kim, and Sean Abi Saab.
2. Kevin Kim read a sequence of integers from the input files "data_random.txt" and "data_sorted.txt". He also performed heap operations and wrote the results into an output file called "outputFile.txt" in the driver program. Sean Abi Saab helped write the MaxHeapInterface.java and MaxHeap.java classes, and helped debug the HeapDriver.java class. He also wrote and created the Javadocs for this project.
3. For this project, we used Java interface. We also have included Javadoc that briefly explains all the methods for this project.
4. Here is the link to [the Javadoc's start page](https://codingtillwedie.github.io/Project-4/package-summary.html).
